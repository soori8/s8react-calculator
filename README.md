## React calculator 
This is my first project with react that i learn many things from it.

- how work with the state and props
- what is "this" in JavaScript and why we need use bind in es6 when we are using classes
- how using immutable data structures

see the demo of this app that deployed on Github [Here...](https://soori8.github.io/s8react-calculator/)
![Preview Image](demo.jpg)

The calculator could be:
- do the main operation
- clear and delete
- use dynamic parenthesis

and also i have a plan to make some changes on it in the future like:
- use javaScript function to do the math instead of use eval()
- recognize the input number in order to handle the negative/positive swicher in calculator
...

i will be glad to hear from you in my first react project.
